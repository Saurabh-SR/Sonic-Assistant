## Known Issues
- Speech recognition might fail in noisy environments.
- Weather updates require a valid city name and API key.
- Limited functionality for note management due to fixed filename length.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for custom voice commands.
- Implement multi-language support.
- Include a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Enhance error handling and command recognition.

## Development Environment
This project was developed using **PyCharm**, a robust and feature-rich IDE for Python development. I personaly loved the code assistance part of it ðŸ™‚
